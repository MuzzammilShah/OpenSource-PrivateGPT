## **🔐Open Source Project Test and Implementation - PrivateGPT by ZylonAI**

&nbsp;

**✍🏻Notes:**
- PrivateGPT is an Open Source project available on the internet.
- These are my notes as to how I had implemented that into my system and used it (The setup process is slightly complicated in the documentations).
- The purpose of this was to establish, run and use my own Private AI without worrying about my data getting leaked.
- Can even use this without internet connection after setup!
